Image::Compare

methods
 - exact
 - threshold
 - threshold_count
 - avg_threshold
 - image

Image::Filter
(blur, channel, edge, emboss, eraseline, floyd, foo, gaussian, greyscale, invert, level, oilify, pizelize, posterize, ripple, rotate, sharpen, solarize, swirl, twirl)

other ideas 
 - straight md5 or sha1 checksum
 - phash?? (good for scaling)
 - SIFT (good for cropped/rotation/lighting)

-->> from my brain!
idea(w/ Image::Hash)->can specify smaller geometries in dhash,phash

-->> update
after my aforementioned idea was implemented, kept getting the following error (times 1000)
Use of uninitialized value in multiplication (*) at /usr/local/share/perl/5.26.1/Image/Hash.pm line 439.
is it related to a bug in passing the geometry? (was trying to do 6x6)
